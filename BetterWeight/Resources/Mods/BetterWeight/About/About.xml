[Requires MinifyEverything or similar]
Ever notices that many building have a weight of 1kg? Well that sometimes just doesn't make sense.
This mod fixes that by adding the weight of the materials needed to build it and multiplying that by 0.65 (Default)

Makes MinifyEverything much more balanced. No more stealing 1kg solar panels from bases!

This mod supports all mods that add buildings so just as MinifyEverything makes more things minifiable this will give them a resonable mass.

Many options to configure!
Enabled/Disable each building from having its weight updated (So you can even change the mass of buildings that normally have a mass)
Change the efficiency of the mass conversion. (BetterWeight = Î£[Weight of materials needed to construct] * efficiency)
Choose how many decimal places to round the new mass to
Choose whether to round all masses to the nearest 5 like the base game does or not.
